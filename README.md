**Project description**

This project aims to deploy individual containers easily and quickly for each student. They were originally designed for cybersecurity students. This allows them to have a laboratory available to work and learn basic commands.

A terminal sharing feature is included. A teacher can connect to the student's container and see in real time what the student is doing. They can also type on their behalf to help them.
